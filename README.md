# Prompetize

**Prompetize** is an open-source Chrome extension designed to streamline the management, versioning, and sharing of prompt templates. It transforms your collection of prompts into a centralized, searchable repository with built-in version control and insightful analytics. By eliminating endless copy-paste cycles, Prompetize keeps your best prompt ideas at your fingertipsâ€”because every great conversation starts with the right prompt. The extension leverages GitHub for change tracking and collaboration via client-side OAuth, with no third-party backend involved.

Details TBD.
