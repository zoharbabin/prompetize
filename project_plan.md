## System Architecture and Design Principles

### Modular and Scalable Architecture

Prompetize is built on a modular philosophy, separating the core functionalities (like prompt management and analytics) from integration and extension modules. This design ensures that the extension remains scalable and maintainable—even as new features and plugins join the party.

### Integration Strategy

The product is designed to integrate seamlessly with external systems (e.g., version control platforms and chat interfaces) without locking you into a rigid framework. The idea is to keep integrations light and user-focused, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.

### Data Management and Analytics

Data is at the heart of Prompetize. By implementing a clear strategy for managing prompt data and usage metrics, the product aims to offer actionable insights while keeping user data secure and under their control.

### Extensibility and Plugin System

The architecture includes clearly defined extension points. This means third-party developers can create plugins that add new features or tweak existing ones—all without modifying the core functionality. In short, Prompetize is built to evolve with its community.
