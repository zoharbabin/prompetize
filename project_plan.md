## Introduction

Prompetize is an open-source browser (Google Chrome) extension designed to streamline the management, versioning, and sharing of prompt templates. By integrating directly with GitHub for version control and collaboration, and incorporating analytics, chat platform integration, and a plugin-friendly architecture, Prompetize empowers users—from prompt power-users to collaborative teams—to organize and optimize their prompt libraries efficiently.

This document provides a detailed, end-to-end guide for building the project from scratch, with a clean and structured plan that incorporates lessons learned from a previously messy project. It is intended to serve as both a roadmap for implementation and a comprehensive reference for best practices.

## System Architecture and Design

### Modular Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Organize the codebase into distinct modules:
  - **Background Scripts:** Service workers managing core logic.
  - **Popup, Options, DevTools, and Content Scripts:** Each with dedicated folders and responsibilities.
  - **Services:** Core business logic for GitHub integration, analytics, data caching, synchronization, and chat platform integration.
  - **Plugins:** A dedicated module for managing third-party extensions and custom features.

- **ADR Documentation:**  
  Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document decisions such as technology stack selection, GitHub integration, local storage, analytics, and more. Ensure a clear, consolidated, and periodically updated documentation framework.

### GitHub Integration and Version Control

- **Authentication:**  
  Implement secure OAuth flows using Chrome’s Identity API. Tokens are stored (preferably encrypted) in the browser’s local storage.
  
- **Git Operations:**  
  Use GitHub’s REST API for commits, pushes, pulls, and merge conflict handling. Provide both a default public repository option for community contributions and the ability for personal repository integration.

### Analytics and Data Management

- **Local Data Cache:**  
  Utilize Chrome’s Storage API for fast, offline-accessible prompt data caching, with encryption for sensitive information.
  
- **Analytics Module:**  
  Record events for prompt creation, usage, modification, synchronization, and errors. Process and visualize metrics using Chart.js.

### Chat Platform Integration

- **Dynamic Injection:**  
  Deploy content scripts that detect supported chat platform domains (e.g., chat.openai.com, claude.ai) and dynamically inject a UI widget (e.g., a “Templates” button) for one-click prompt insertion.
  
- **User Interaction:**  
  Support dynamic placeholders and keyboard shortcuts to further streamline prompt insertion.

### Extensibility and Plugin System

- **Plugin Manager:**  
  Provide APIs for third-party developers to register, configure, and manage plugins, allowing for future feature expansion without modifying core code.
  
- **Modularity:**  
  Ensure that all modules interact through well-defined interfaces, enabling easy maintenance and scalability.
