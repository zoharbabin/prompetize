# Prompetize: Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Setting up the project structure and initializing the memory bank files.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created the `memory-bank` directory.
*   Created the `projectbrief.md` file.
*   Created the `productContext.md` file.

**Next Steps:**

*   Create the remaining memory bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`).
*   Set up the basic file structure for the Chrome extension (`manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, etc.).

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   How to best structure the Chrome extension files.
*   Which version control system to integrate with.
*   How to design the analytics dashboard.
