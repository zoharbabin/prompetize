# Prompetize: Progress

**What Works:**

*   Created the `memory-bank` directory.

*   Created the `systemPatterns.md` file.
*   Created the `techContext.md` file.
*   Set up the basic file structure for the Chrome extension (`manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `popup.css`, `images`).

*   Added a button to the popup to add a new prompt.
*   Set up automated testing with Jest.
*   Configured webpack for building the extension.
