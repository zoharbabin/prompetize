# ADR-016: Consolidation and Streamlining of ADR Documentation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our project currently has a large number of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), including multiple documents that appear to cover the same conceptual space (e.g., two separate ADRs addressing the review and update of existing ADRs: one labeled as ADR-006 and another as ADR-015). In addition, other ADRs (e.g., update priorities, documentation practices, and maintenance strategies) have evolved as the project has grown. This has led to duplication, potential inconsistencies, and ambiguity in the architectural documentation which may impact decision-making and alignment across the project.

## Decision
We propose to consolidate and streamline the ADR documentation by:
- Merging duplicate ADRs related to the review and update of existing ADRs.
- Establishing a clear process and schedule for periodic review and updates to all ADRs.
- Renumbering or reclassifying ADRs as needed to maintain a consistent and logical sequence.
- Documenting the rationale behind each decision and ensuring alignment with current implementation status and product priorities.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Enhanced clarity and consistency in architectural documentation, improved maintainability of ADR records, and a structured process for future updates.
- **Negative:** Short-term effort required to review, merge, and update existing ADRs, and potential rework if established decisions need to be revised.

## Rationale
As the project evolves, keeping architectural documentation coherent is critical. The current state—marked by overlapping and potentially conflicting ADRs—undermines the effectiveness of these records as a guiding artifact. Consolidating these records will ensure that our team and stakeholders have a reliable source of truth that accurately reflects current architectural decisions, priorities, and planned evolutions.

## Implementation Plan
1. Conduct a thorough audit of all existing ADRs.
2. Identify overlapping content, particularly in ADR-006 and ADR-015, and merge them.
3. Define a standardized template and numbering system for ADRs moving forward.
4. Set a quarterly review schedule to ensure the ADR documentation remains current.
5. Update related ADRs (e.g., those covering priorities, documentation practices) to align with the new consolidated ADR.
6. Communicate changes and rationale to all team stakeholders.
