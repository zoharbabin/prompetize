# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

### Status

Proposed

### Context

Prompetize aims to develop an open-source Chrome extension with robust features for managing, versioning, and sharing prompt templates. The project requires a scalable, maintainable, and efficient technology stack that aligns with modern development practices and ensures seamless integration with GitHub and various chat platforms.

### Decision
Adopt the following technology stack for the Prompetize project:

- **Frontend Framework:** **React** with **TypeScript**
  - **Reasoning:** React offers a component-based architecture, promoting reusability and easier maintenance. TypeScript adds static typing, enhancing code reliability and developer productivity.
  
- **Build Tool:** **Vite 6**
  - **Reasoning:** Vite provides a fast development server and optimized build processes, improving developer experience and build performance.
  
- **State Management:** **Redux Toolkit**
  - **Reasoning:** Simplifies state management with less boilerplate, ensuring scalable and predictable state handling.
  
- **Styling:** **CSS Modules** with **Sass**
  - **Reasoning:** CSS Modules provide scoped and maintainable styles, while Sass offers advanced styling features.
  
- **Linting & Formatting:** **ESLint** and **Prettier**
  - **Reasoning:** Enforce code quality and consistency across the codebase, reducing bugs and improving readability.
  
- **Version Control:** **GitHub**
  - **Reasoning:** Facilitates collaboration, version tracking, and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.
  
- **Additional Tool:** **webextension-polyfill**
  - **Reasoning:** Simplifies cross-browser extension development by providing a standardized API, reducing the need for conditional code based on the browser.

### Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enhanced developer productivity with modern tools and frameworks.
  - Improved code quality and maintainability through TypeScript and linting tools.
  - Faster development and build times with Vite.
  - Strong community support and extensive resources available for the selected technologies.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Initial learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript or Vite.
  - Potential overkill for smaller features, but justified by the project's scalability requirements.

### Security Considerations

- **Dependency Management:** Utilize tools like `npm audit` to regularly scan for and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Type Safety:** Leveraging TypeScript reduces runtime errors and potential security vulnerabilities through static type checking.
- **Build Security:** Ensure that the build process with Vite does not expose sensitive information and follows best security practices.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Adopt TDD practices by writing unit tests before implementing functionality to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- **Automated Testing:**
  - **Unit Tests:** Use frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library to write comprehensive unit tests for React components and Redux logic.
  - **Integration Tests:** Validate the interaction between different modules and components to ensure they work together seamlessly.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Implement E2E tests using tools like Cypress to simulate user interactions and verify the overall functionality of the extension.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate automated testing into the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests on every commit and pull request, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.

### Documentation Updates

- **CHANGELOG:** Maintain a detailed `CHANGELOG.md` that records all significant changes, enhancements, and fixes in each release to provide transparency and traceability.
- **README:** Update the `README.md` to include:
  - Project overview and purpose.
  - Installation and setup instructions.
  - Contribution guidelines.
  - Documentation links.
  - Usage examples and screenshots.
  - Licensing information.

### Summary

This technology stack selection provides a solid foundation for developing the Prompetize Chrome extension, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and security. By adhering to TDD practices and maintaining comprehensive documentation, the development team can deliver a high-quality, reliable product while facilitating collaboration and future enhancements.
