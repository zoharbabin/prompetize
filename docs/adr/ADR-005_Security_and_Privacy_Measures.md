# ADR-005: Security and Privacy Measures

### Status

Proposed

### Context

Prompetize handles sensitive user data, including GitHub authentication tokens and prompt templates. Ensuring data security and user privacy is paramount to maintain trust and comply with best practices. The extension must protect user data both in transit and at rest, adhere to secure coding standards, and provide users with control over their data.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive security and privacy measures as follows:

- **Secure OAuth and Token Handling:**
  - **Implementation:** Use Chrome’s Identity API for secure GitHub authentication.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures secure, client-side authentication without exposing sensitive credentials. The Identity API manages token retrieval and renewal, reducing the risk of token leakage.
  - **Token Storage:** Store access tokens transiently—either in memory or within encrypted browser storage using the Web Crypto API.
    - **Reasoning:** Minimizes the persistence of sensitive tokens, reducing the window of opportunity for potential breaches.
  - **Token Lifecycle:** Ensure tokens are short-lived or auto-renewed to minimize security risks.
    - **Reasoning:** Limits the duration a compromised token remains valid, enhancing overall security.

- **Client-Side Operations:**
  - **Approach:** Perform all GitHub operations client-side to eliminate the need for any third-party backend communications.
    - **Reasoning:** Reduces the attack surface by avoiding intermediary servers that could be targeted for data breaches. Keeps user data under their direct control.

- **Minimal Permissions:**
  - **Strategy:** Request only the minimum required OAuth scopes (e.g., read/write access to the selected repository).
    - **Reasoning:** Adheres to the principle of least privilege, minimizing potential exposure and reducing the impact of compromised tokens.

- **Data Privacy:**
  - **Policy:** Ensure that no prompt data is transmitted to or stored on external servers beyond GitHub repositories.
    - **Reasoning:** Maintains user data privacy by not relying on third-party servers, aligning with privacy best practices.
  - **User Control:** Provide users with clear options to manage their data and revoke access if necessary.
    - **Reasoning:** Empowers users to have ownership and control over their data, fostering trust and transparency.

### Security Considerations

- **Dependency Management:**
  - **Implementation:** Utilize tools like `npm audit` to regularly scan for and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures that all third-party libraries are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities, maintaining the security integrity of the extension.

- **Type Safety:**
  - **Implementation:** Leveraging TypeScript reduces runtime errors and potential security vulnerabilities through static type checking.
    - **Reasoning:** Enhances code reliability and prevents common bugs that could lead to security issues.

- **Build Security:**
  - **Implementation:** Ensure that the build process with Vite does not expose sensitive information and follows best security practices.
    - **Reasoning:** Protects against accidental exposure of sensitive data during the build and deployment phases.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  - **Implementation:** Define a strict CSP in the `manifest.json` to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.
    - **Reasoning:** Mitigates the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling the sources of executable content.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
  - **Implementation:** Sanitize all user inputs and prompt data before processing or storing them.
    - **Reasoning:** Prevents injection attacks and ensures that only valid and expected data is handled by the extension.

- **Integrate Advanced Threat Detection:** Consider incorporating advanced threat detection mechanisms or libraries to proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats.
- **User Education on Security Practices:** Expand the documentation updates to include user-facing security guidelines, educating users on best practices for maintaining their own security.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
  - **Approach:** Adopt TDD by writing tests for each security and privacy feature before implementing them.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures that security measures are rigorously tested and validated, promoting robust and secure code.

- **Automated Testing:**
  - **Unit Tests:**
    - **Implementation:** Utilize Jest to write unit tests for functions handling authentication, token management, and data storage.
    - **Reasoning:** Verifies that individual components function correctly and securely in isolation.
  
  - **Integration Tests:**
    - **Implementation:** Validate the interaction between authentication flows, GitHub API interactions, and data storage modules.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures that integrated components work together seamlessly without introducing security vulnerabilities.
  
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    - **Implementation:** Implement E2E tests using Cypress to simulate user interactions with authentication, data management, and GitHub synchronization features.
    - **Reasoning:** Verifies that the extension operates securely and as expected from the user's perspective, ensuring comprehensive coverage of security flows.
  
  - **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    - **Integration:** Incorporate automated security tests into the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests on every commit and pull request.
      - **Reasoning:** Maintains code security by ensuring that new changes do not introduce vulnerabilities, and that existing security measures remain effective.

- **Security Audits:**
  - **Implementation:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews focused on authentication mechanisms, data handling, and dependency vulnerabilities.
    - **Reasoning:** Identifies and addresses potential security issues proactively, maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the extension.

### Documentation Updates

- **CHANGELOG:**
  - **Maintenance:** 
    - Maintain a comprehensive `CHANGELOG.md` that records all significant changes related to security and privacy measures, including bug fixes, enhancements, and security patches.
    - Each entry should include the version number, date, and a brief description of the changes.
    - **Reasoning:** Provides transparency and traceability for users and contributors, facilitating easier tracking of security-related improvements and updates.
  
- **README:**
  - **Enhancements:** 
    - **Security Practices:** Detail the security measures implemented, including OAuth handling, data encryption, minimal permissions, and data privacy policies.
    - **Usage Guidelines:** Provide instructions on setting up GitHub authentication securely, managing tokens, and configuring repository settings.
    - **Troubleshooting:** Offer solutions for common security issues, such as token renewal failures or data synchronization errors.
    - **Contribution Guidelines:** Outline best practices for securely contributing to the codebase, including coding standards, security checks, and testing requirements.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures that users and contributors are well-informed about the security and privacy practices, fostering a secure and trustworthy environment.

### Summary
