# ADR-015: Review and Update of Existing ADRs

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Prompetize maintains a series of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document key architectural decisions. Currently, the project has ADRs ranging from ADR-001 to ADR-015, with ADR-006 having been renamed to ADR-007 to resolve numbering conflicts. To ensure consistency, clarity, and alignment between the documented decisions and the current state of the codebase, a comprehensive review of all ADRs is necessary. This review identifies which ADRs have been fully implemented, which require updates, and addresses any inconsistencies in ADR numbering.

## Decision

### Actions to be Taken

1. **Ensure Unique ADR Numbering:**
   
   - **Issue:** Previously, ADR-006 was duplicated (`ADR-006_Analytics_Module_Integration.md` and `ADR-006_Review_and_Update_of_existing_ADRs.md`). This has been resolved by renaming the latter to `ADR-007_Review_and_Update_of_existing_ADRs.md`.
   
   - **Solution:** Maintain a unique and sequential ADR numbering system. Confirm that no further ADRs have numbering conflicts by periodically reviewing the `docs/adr/` directory.

2. **Assess Implementation Status of Each ADR:**
   
   - **ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection.md**
     - **Status:** Partially Implemented
     - **Justification:** The codebase utilizes React with TypeScript, Vite as the build tool, ESLint, Prettier, and webextension-polyfill as specified in the ADR. However, Redux Toolkit and CSS Modules with Sass are not yet implemented.
   
   - **ADR-002: GitHub Integration Approach.md**
     - **Status:** Partially Implemented
     - **Justification:** GitHub integration features such as authentication via Chrome's Identity API and Git operations through GitHub's REST API are present. However, detailed rate limiting strategies and merge conflict resolutions require further development.
   
   - **ADR-003: Local Storage and Data Management.md**
     - **Status:** Implemented
     - **Justification:** The project employs Chromeâ€™s Storage API for local data caching and synchronizes with GitHub repositories for persistence, fully aligning with the ADR's decisions.
   
   - **ADR-004: Chat Platform Integration Strategy.md**
     - **Status:** Implemented
     - **Justification:** Integration with supported chat platforms is achieved through dynamic content script injection, robust error handling, and comprehensive testing as outlined in the ADR.
   
   - **ADR-005: Security and Privacy Measures.md**
     - **Status:** Implemented
     - **Justification:** Security measures including secure OAuth flows, minimal permissions, data encryption, and adherence to Content Security Policies (CSP) are enforced in the codebase.
   
   - **ADR-006: Analytics Module Integration.md**
     - **Status:** Not Implemented
     - **Justification:** No evidence of an Analytics Module integration is found within the current codebase files.
   
   - **ADR-007: Extensibility and Scalability Architecture.md**
     - **Status:** Partially Implemented
     - **Justification:** The codebase demonstrates a modular architecture through service classes (e.g., `GitHubAuthService`, `GitHubApiService`, `RepositoryManagementService`, `GitHubService`, `GitHubError`) and a `RateLimiter` in `background.ts`. However, the plugin architecture components, such as plugin management and defined extension points, are not yet fully implemented.
   
   - **ADR-008: Prioritizing ADR Implementation - GitHub Integration Approach.md**
     - **Status:** Implemented
     - **Justification:** ADR-008 outlines the prioritization of ADR-002, which aligns with the ongoing partial implementation of GitHub integration.
   
   - **ADR-009: Update Priorities for Prompetize Based on Current Status.md**
     - **Status:** Implemented
     - **Justification:** ADR-009 provides a comprehensive update plan based on the current implementation status, aligning with ongoing efforts to prioritize and implement key ADRs.
   
   - **ADR-011: Market Strategy and Positioning.md**
     - **Status:** Implemented
     - **Justification:** The market strategy has been outlined and aligns with the product's goals and target audiences.
   
   - **ADR-012: Documentation Practices.md**
     - **Status:** Partially Implemented
     - **Justification:** The `README.md` exists and provides a basic overview. However, contributor documentation such as `CONTRIBUTING.md` is not yet implemented.
   
   - **ADR-013: Maintenance and Support Strategy.md**
     - **Status:** Not Reviewed
     - **Justification:** Pending review.
   
   - **ADR-014: Future Enhancements and Roadmap.md**
     - **Status:** Not Reviewed
     - **Justification:** Pending review.
   
   - **ADR-015: Review and Update of Existing ADRs.md**
     - **Status:** Implemented
     - **Justification:** This ADR outlines the review and update process for existing ADRs.

3. **Determine ADRs for Deletion or Update:**
   
   - **ADRs Eligible for Deletion:**
     - **None:** All ADRs currently guide ongoing implementations or require updates to reflect partial implementations.
   
   - **ADRs Requiring Updates:**
     - **ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection.md**
       - **Updates Needed:** 
         - Implement Redux Toolkit for state management.
         - Align styling methodology by finalizing the decision to continue with TailwindCSS or adopt CSS Modules with Sass.
     
     - **ADR-002: GitHub Integration Approach.md**
       - **Updates Needed:**
         - Enhance rate limiting strategies by implementing exponential backoff and request queuing mechanisms.
         - Develop UI components for merge conflict resolution within the extension.
     
     - **ADR-007: Extensibility and Scalability Architecture.md**
       - **Updates Needed:**
         - Implement the Plugin Architecture components, including defining clear APIs and extension points.
         - Develop a plugin manager within the extension to support discovering, installing, enabling, disabling, and configuring plugins.
     
     - **ADR-012: Documentation Practices.md**
       - **Updates Needed:**
         - Implement `CONTRIBUTING.md` to provide clear contribution guidelines.
         - Develop comprehensive user guides and tutorials.
         - Establish a documentation review process to ensure ongoing accuracy and relevance.
