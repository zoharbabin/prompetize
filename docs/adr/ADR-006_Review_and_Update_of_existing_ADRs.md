# ADR-006: Review and Update of Existing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The Prompetize project maintains a series of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document key technical and architectural decisions. These ADRs include:

- ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection
- ADR-002: GitHub Integration Approach
- ADR-003: Local Storage and Data Management
- ADR-004: Chat Platform Integration Strategy
- ADR-005: Security and Privacy Measures

With the project's current structure and features as outlined in the `README.md`, it is essential to ensure that all ADRs accurately reflect the project's state, utilities, and capabilities. This review aims to validate the alignment of existing ADRs with the project's implementation and identify any necessary updates to maintain coherence and relevance.
## Decision
After a thorough review of all existing ADRs in conjunction with the project's current structure and objectives, the following conclusions and actions are proposed:
### 1. ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Findings:**
- The selected technology stack (React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS 4, Vite 6) aligns well with the project's goals of scalability, maintainability, and performance.
### 3. ADR-003: Local Storage and Data Management
### 3. ADR-003: Local Storage and Data Management

**Findings:**
- The hybrid storage strategy effectively balances local performance with reliable data persistence through GitHub synchronization.
- Security measures like data encryption and access controls are appropriately addressed.

**Recommendations:**
- **Specify Encryption Standards:** Define the specific encryption algorithms and practices to be used with the Web Crypto API to ensure consistency and security.
- **Outline Synchronization Frequency:** Include details on how often synchronization with GitHub occurs and how conflicts are detected and resolved.

### 4. ADR-004: Chat Platform Integration Strategy

**Findings:**
- The strategy for integrating with multiple chat platforms using dynamic content script injection is robust and considers resilience to UI changes.
- Comprehensive security considerations, including CSP and input sanitization, are well-covered.

**Recommendations:**
- **Expand on MutationObserver Implementation:** Provide more technical details or references on implementing MutationObservers to assist developers in maintaining the integration.
- **Include Performance Metrics:** Add performance benchmarks or targets to ensure that DOM monitoring and script injection do not adversely affect browser performance.

### 5. ADR-005: Security and Privacy Measures

**Findings:**
- The security measures, including secure OAuth flows, minimal permissions, and data encryption, are thoroughly documented and align with best practices.
- Continuous integration of security tests ensures ongoing vigilance against vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations:**
- **Integrate Advanced Threat Detection:** Consider incorporating advanced threat detection mechanisms or libraries to proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats.
- **User Education on Security Practices:** Expand the documentation updates to include user-facing security guidelines, educating users on best practices for maintaining their own security.
### 2. ADR-002: GitHub Integration Approach

**Findings:**
- The integration approach using Chrome’s Identity API and GitHub’s REST API is well-documented and follows secure authentication practices.
- Emphasis on direct interaction with GitHub repositories ensures data remains under user control.

**Recommendations:**
- **Detail Rate Limiting Strategies:** Expand the consequences section to include strategies for handling GitHub API rate limits beyond just noting their existence.
- **Enhance Merge Conflict Handling:** Provide more detailed methodologies for resolving merge conflicts within the extension’s UI, possibly referencing specific libraries or patterns to be used.

**Findings:**
- The hybrid storage strategy effectively balances local performance with reliable data persistence through GitHub synchronization.
- Security measures like data encryption and access controls are appropriately addressed.

**Recommendations:**
- **Specify Encryption Standards:** Define the specific encryption algorithms and practices to be used with the Web Crypto API to ensure consistency and security.
- **Outline Synchronization Frequency:** Include details on how often synchronization with GitHub occurs and how conflicts are detected and resolved.
