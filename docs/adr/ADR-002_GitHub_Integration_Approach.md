# ADR-002: GitHub Integration Approach

### Status

Proposed

### Context

Prompetize requires seamless integration with GitHub to manage prompt templates with version control. The integration should support CRUD operations, commit tracking, and repository management without relying on a third-party backend. Ensuring secure authentication, data integrity, and efficient synchronization between the extension and GitHub repositories are critical for maintaining user trust and operational reliability.

### Decision
Implement GitHub integration using the following comprehensive approach:

- **Authentication:** Utilize Chrome’s Identity API to handle OAuth flows securely.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures secure, client-side authentication without exposing sensitive credentials. The Identity API handles token management, reducing the risk of token leakage.

- **Git Operations:** Leverage GitHub’s REST API for performing commits, pushes, pulls, and merges.
  - **Reasoning:** Provides direct interaction with GitHub repositories, eliminating the need for intermediary servers. This reduces latency and potential points of failure while ensuring data remains under the user's control.

- **Repository Management:**
  - **Default Public Repository:** Offer a default repository (`prompetize-community/prompts`) for community collaboration.
    - **Reasoning:** Facilitates easy sharing and collaboration among users without requiring individual repository setup, lowering the barrier to entry.
  - **Personal Repository Option:** Allow users to select or configure their own repositories (public or private) via an advanced settings panel.
    - **Reasoning:** Provides flexibility for users with specific privacy needs or who prefer personal repository management, catering to a wider user base.

- **Version Control:** Implement automatic commit messages tied to user actions within the extension.
  - **Reasoning:** Maintains a clear and descriptive commit history, facilitating easier tracking and collaboration. Automated commit messages reduce the likelihood of inconsistent or missing commit information.

### Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - **Reliability and Security:** Direct integration with GitHub enhances reliability and security by minimizing dependencies on external services.
  - **Flexibility:** Users can choose between a default shared repository and personal repositories, accommodating different collaboration preferences.
  - **Maintainability:** Eliminates the need for maintaining a separate backend, reducing operational overhead and potential security vulnerabilities.
  - **Enhanced Collaboration:** Facilitates community-driven improvements and sharing through the default public repository.
  - **Detailed Rate Limiting Strategies:** Implement mechanisms such as exponential backoff or request queuing to handle GitHub API rate limits, and inform users when rate limits are reached to prevent service disruptions.

- **Cons:**
  - **API Rate Limits:** Reliance on GitHub’s API rate limits may affect performance during high usage periods.
  - **Merge Conflicts:** Handling merge conflicts within the extension’s UI adds complexity and requires robust conflict resolution mechanisms.
  - **Dependency on GitHub:** Any changes or deprecations in GitHub’s API could necessitate updates to the integration logic.

### Security Considerations

- **OAuth Flow Security:**
  - **Secure Token Handling:** Use Chrome’s secure storage mechanisms to store OAuth tokens, ensuring they are not exposed to unauthorized parties.
  - **Token Expiration and Renewal:** Implement strategies for token expiration and automatic renewal to maintain session security and minimize the risk of token misuse.
    
- **Data Protection:**
  - **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data stored locally before synchronization with GitHub to protect user data from unauthorized access.
  - **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all data before committing to GitHub to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
  - **Graceful Handling:** Implement retry mechanisms and inform users when GitHub API rate limits are reached to prevent disruption of service.
  - **Usage Monitoring:** Monitor API usage to anticipate and mitigate potential rate limit issues proactively.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
  - **Approach:** Adopt TDD by writing unit and integration tests for each functional component related to GitHub integration before implementing the corresponding features. This ensures that the codebase is robust, reliable, and maintainable.
    
- **Automated Testing:**
  - **Unit Tests:** Utilize Jest to write unit tests for authentication flows, Git operations, repository management logic, and input validation functions.
  - **Integration Tests:** Validate the interaction between the extension and GitHub’s REST API, ensuring seamless CRUD operations and synchronization. Tests should cover scenarios such as successful commits, push failures due to network issues, and proper handling of API rate limits.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Implement E2E tests using Cypress to simulate user interactions with GitHub integration features within the extension. These tests should verify that prompts are correctly managed, synchronized, and retrieved across different repositories.
    
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - **Integration:** Incorporate automated tests into the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions. Configure workflows to run tests on every commit and pull request, ensuring that new changes do not break existing integration functionalities.
  - **Coverage Reports:** Generate and monitor test coverage reports to identify and address untested parts of the codebase, striving for high coverage to increase code reliability.

### Documentation Updates

- **CHANGELOG:**
  - **Maintenance:** Maintain a comprehensive `CHANGELOG.md` that records all significant changes related to GitHub integration features, including bug fixes, enhancements, security updates, and performance improvements. Each entry should include the version number, date, and a brief description of the changes.
    
- **README:**
  - **Enhancements:** Update `README.md` to include detailed sections on:
    - **GitHub Integration Setup:** Step-by-step instructions on setting up GitHub authentication, selecting default or personal repositories, and configuring repository settings.
    - **Usage Guidelines:** Examples and screenshots illustrating how to perform CRUD operations, manage repositories, and resolve common issues.
    - **Troubleshooting:** Common problems and their solutions related to GitHub integration, such as handling merge conflicts, API rate limit issues, and authentication errors.
    - **Contribution Guidelines:** Instructions for developers contributing to the GitHub integration features, including coding standards, testing requirements, and pull request processes.
    - **Security Practices:** Overview of implemented security measures, including OAuth handling, data encryption, and access controls, to assure users of data protection.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures that users and contributors are well-informed about the security and privacy practices, fostering a secure and trustworthy environment.

### Summary

This GitHub Integration Approach ensures secure, reliable, and scalable management of prompt templates through direct interaction with GitHub’s REST API. By adhering to TDD practices and maintaining thorough documentation, the development team can deliver a seamless integration experience while ensuring code quality, security, and facilitating future enhancements. Comprehensive testing and security measures protect user data and maintain the integrity of prompt management processes, aligning with the overall objectives of the Prompetize project.
