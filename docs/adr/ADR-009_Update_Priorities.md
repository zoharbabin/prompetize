## Overview

This ADR Update Plan outlines the next steps for the **Prompetize** project, based on the current **Product Plan**, **Implementation Status**, and `package.json` dependencies. It aims to align the project with its architectural goals, improve code quality, and ensure scalability and security.

## Reviewed Artifacts

- **Product Plan (`product_plan.md`):** Comprehensive overview of project objectives, features, and roadmap.
- **Implementation Status (`docs/adr/Implementation_Status.md`):** Current status of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
- **Package Configuration (`package.json`):** Project dependencies, scripts, and configurations.
- **Codebase (`src/services/github/*`):** Implementation of GitHub integration services.

## Recommendations

### 1. Complete Partial Implementations of ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

#### 1.1 Implement State Management with Redux Toolkit

- **Justification:**
  - **Maintainability & Scalability:** Redux Toolkit simplifies state management, reduces boilerplate, and enhances scalability as the project grows.
  - **Alignment with ADR:** ADR-001 specifies the use of Redux Toolkit, which is currently not implemented.
  - **Developer Experience:** Promotes best practices and standardized state handling across the codebase.

- **Proposed Actions:**
  1. Add `@reduxjs/toolkit` to `dependencies` in `package.json`.
  2. Refactor existing state management logic to utilize Redux Toolkit.
  3. Update `README.md` with guidelines on state management using Redux Toolkit.

#### 1.2 Align Styling Methodology

- **Option A: Adopt CSS Modules with Sass**
  - **Justification:**
    - **Modularity:** Encapsulates styles at the component level, preventing style leakage.
    - **Flexibility:** Sass offers advanced styling features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
    - **Consistency:** Aligns with the initial ADR-001 proposal.

  - **Proposed Actions:**
    1. Integrate `sass` into `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
    2. Refactor existing TailwindCSS styles to CSS Modules with Sass.
    3. Update `vite.config.js` to support CSS Modules and Sass.

- **Option B: Continue with TailwindCSS**
  - **Justification:**
    - **Utility-First Approach:** Rapid UI development with predefined classes.
    - **Consistency & Responsiveness:** Ensures a consistent design system across components.
