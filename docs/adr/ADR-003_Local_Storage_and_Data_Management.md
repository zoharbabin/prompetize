# ADR-003: Local Storage and Data Management

### Status

Partially Implemented
- Local Data Cache: Implemented (encryption service added)
- GitHub Sync Module: Not yet implemented

### Context

Prompetize needs to manage prompt templates efficiently, ensuring quick access, offline availability, and synchronization with GitHub repositories. The solution should balance local performance with reliable data persistence.

### Decision

Adopt a hybrid storage strategy combining Chrome’s Storage API and GitHub synchronization:

- **Local Data Cache:**
  - **Implementation:** Use Chrome’s Storage API to store prompt data locally.
  - **Reasoning:** Provides fast access to prompts and ensures functionality during offline scenarios.

- **GitHub Sync Module:**
  - **Implementation:** Synchronize local changes with the authenticated user’s GitHub repository.
  - **Reasoning:** Maintains a consistent and version-controlled backup of prompts, leveraging GitHub’s robust infrastructure.

- **Data Schema:**
  - **Format:** JSON-based schema enriched with Git metadata (commit IDs, branch names, timestamps).
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures comprehensive version history and easy data manipulation.

### Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enhanced performance with local caching.
  - Reliable data backup and version control through GitHub synchronization.
  - Offline accessibility ensures uninterrupted user experience.

- **Cons:**
  - Additional complexity in managing synchronization between local storage and GitHub.
  - Potential challenges in resolving conflicts during sync operations.

### Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption:**
  - **Implementation:** Encrypt sensitive prompt data stored locally using the Web Crypto API.
  - **Reasoning:** Protects user data from unauthorized access even if local storage is compromised.

- **Access Control:**
  - **Implementation:** Ensure that only authenticated users can access and modify their prompt data.
  - **Reasoning:** Prevents unauthorized access and modifications, maintaining data integrity.

- **Secure Sync Operations:**
  - **Implementation:** Use HTTPS for all GitHub API interactions to protect data in transit.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures that data synchronization between local storage and GitHub repositories is secure.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Adopt TDD by writing tests for storage operations before implementing them to ensure reliability and maintainability.

- **Automated Testing:**
  - **Unit Tests:** Utilize Jest to write unit tests for functions handling local storage operations and GitHub synchronization logic.
  - **Integration Tests:** Verify the interaction between Chrome’s Storage API and GitHub’s REST API to ensure seamless data synchronization.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Implement E2E tests using Cypress to simulate user interactions with prompt management features, ensuring that prompts are correctly stored, synced, and retrieved.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Incorporate automated tests into the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests on every commit and pull request, ensuring that new changes do not break existing storage and synchronization functionalities.

### Documentation Updates

- **CHANGELOG:**
  - **Maintenance:** 
    - Document all changes related to local storage and data management, including new features, bug fixes, and security enhancements.
    - Provide versioned entries with dates and descriptions to maintain transparency and traceability.

- **README:**
  - **Enhancements:** 
    - **Local Storage Setup:** Include instructions on configuring local storage and integrating with GitHub repositories.
    - **Usage Guidelines:** Detail how to manage prompt templates, handle synchronization, and troubleshoot common issues.

### Summary

This Local Storage and Data Management strategy ensures that Prompetize delivers a high-performance user experience with reliable data persistence and synchronization. By incorporating comprehensive security measures and adhering to TDD practices, the development team can maintain data integrity, protect user information, and facilitate seamless collaboration through GitHub integration. Thorough documentation further supports developers in implementing and maintaining these capabilities effectively.
