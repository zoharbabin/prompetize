- **Scalability and Maintainability Planning:**
  - **Implementation:** Design future features with scalability and maintainability in mind, adhering to best practices and architectural guidelines established in previous ADRs (e.g., Extensibility and Scalability Architecture, Modular Design).
  - **Reasoning:** Prevents technical debt and ensures that the extension can accommodate new functionalities without compromising performance or stability.

- **Resource Allocation and Timeline Management:**
  - **Implementation:** Assign dedicated resources and define realistic timelines for each phase of the roadmap. Utilize project management tools to track progress and ensure adherence to schedules.
  - **Reasoning:** Facilitates efficient project execution, ensuring that development milestones are met and that resources are utilized effectively.

- **Risk Management:**
  - **Implementation:** Identify potential risks associated with future enhancements, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or market shifts. Develop mitigation strategies and contingency plans to address these risks proactively.
  - **Reasoning:** Enhances project resilience, minimizing the impact of unforeseen issues and ensuring sustained progress towards roadmap goals.

### Consequences

  - **Implementation:** Incorporate privacy considerations into the design and development of future features, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
  - **Reasoning:** Protects user privacy and enhances trust by ensuring that new features do not compromise data security or privacy.

- **Secure Integration Practices:**
  - **Implementation:** When adding integrations with third-party platforms or services, follow secure integration practices, including validation of external data and use of secure APIs.
  - **Reasoning:** Prevents security breaches through third-party integrations, ensuring that external interactions do not introduce vulnerabilities.

### Testing Strategy

- **Feature-Specific Testing:**
  - **Implementation:** Develop thorough test cases for each new feature, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests to ensure functionality and security.
  - **Reasoning:** Guarantees that new features perform as intended and do not introduce bugs or vulnerabilities, maintaining overall extension quality.
  
- **Regression Testing:**
  - **Implementation:** Implement automated regression tests to verify that new developments do not negatively impact existing features.
  - **Reasoning:** Maintains the stability and reliability of the extension, ensuring that updates and enhancements do not disrupt user workflows.
  
- **Performance Testing:**
  - **Implementation:** Conduct performance evaluations for new features to ensure they do not adversely affect the extension’s responsiveness and efficiency.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures that the extension remains performant as new functionalities are added, providing a seamless user experience.
  
- **Security Testing:**
  - **Implementation:** Integrate security testing tools (e.g., Snyk) into the testing pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in new code and dependencies.
  - **Reasoning:** Continuously protects the extension from emerging security threats, maintaining user trust and compliance with security standards.
  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
  - **Implementation:** Engage a group of beta users to validate new features and gather feedback before full-scale deployment.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures that features meet user expectations and function correctly in real-world scenarios, enhancing overall user satisfaction.

### Documentation Updates
