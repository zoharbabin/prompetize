# ADR-006: Analytics Module Integration

### Status
Implemented

### Context
Prompetize aims to provide insightful analytics to users regarding their prompt usage and version control. An Analytics Module is essential for tracking prompt performance, usage trends, and facilitating data-driven optimizations. The module must seamlessly integrate with existing components, ensure data privacy, and provide actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard.

### Decision
Implement the Analytics Module with the following approach:

- **Data Collection:**
  - **Implementation:** Capture relevant events such as prompt creation, modification, usage frequency, and user interactions within the extension.
  - **Reasoning:** Enables comprehensive tracking of prompt life cycles and user engagement.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented with typed events and accurate timestamp handling.

- **Data Storage:**
  - **Implementation:** Utilize Chrome's Storage API for temporary storage and synchronize aggregate data with GitHub repositories for persistence.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures data is readily available for analysis while maintaining user control over data synchronization.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented using Chrome Storage API with efficient data management.

- **Data Processing:**
  - **Implementation:** Process collected data client-side using JavaScript to generate metrics and insights.
  - **Reasoning:** Minimizes data transmission, enhancing privacy and reducing dependencies on external services.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented with comprehensive metrics calculation and time-range filtering.

- **Visualization:**
  - **Implementation:** Develop a dashboard within the extension UI using Chart.js to display usage statistics, trends, and insights.
  - **Reasoning:** Provides users with a clear and interactive way to understand their prompt usage and make informed decisions.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented with interactive charts and responsive design.

- **Reporting:**
  - **Implementation:** Allow users to export analytics data in formats such as CSV or JSON for offline analysis.
  - **Reasoning:** Facilitates further data manipulation and integration with other tools as per user needs.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented with both JSON and CSV export options.

### Implementation Details

- **Analytics Service (`src/services/analytics.ts`):**
  - Event tracking system with typed events
  - Metrics calculation with time-range support
  - Data export functionality
  - Comprehensive test coverage

- **Analytics Dashboard (`src/pages/options/components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`):**
  - Interactive charts using Chart.js
  - Time range filtering (week/month/all)
  - Export functionality
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

- **Key Metrics Implemented:**
  - Total prompts count
  - Usage statistics per prompt
  - Modification frequency
  - Sync frequency

### Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - **Insightful Metrics:** Empowers users with data-driven insights to optimize their prompt strategies.
  - **User Engagement:** Enhances user experience by providing valuable feedback on prompt performance.
  - **Privacy-Preserving:** Ensures data is processed locally, maintaining user privacy and control.
  - **Scalability:** Modular design allows for future expansion of analytics capabilities without disrupting core functionalities.

- **Cons:**
  - **Development Complexity:** Required significant development effort for data collection, processing, and visualization.
  - **Performance Overhead:** Mitigated through efficient data processing and storage strategies.
  - **Data Management:** Implemented careful planning and robust error handling.

### Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy:**
  - **Implementation:** Analytics data is processed entirely client-side with no external transmission.
  - **Reasoning:** Maximizes user privacy and control over their data.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented with client-side processing.

- **Secure Data Handling:**
  - **Implementation:** Data stored securely using Chrome Storage API.
  - **Reasoning:** Leverages browser's built-in security mechanisms.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented with secure storage.

- **Access Control:**
  - **Implementation:** Analytics data restricted to the extension's context.
  - **Reasoning:** Prevents unauthorized access to user analytics.
  - **Status:** ✅ Implemented with proper access controls.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test Coverage:**
  - Unit tests for analytics service
  - Integration tests for data processing
  - Edge case handling
  - All tests passing

### Documentation Updates

- **CHANGELOG:**
