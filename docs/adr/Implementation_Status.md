## Implemented ADRs

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

- **Frontend Framework:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** The project utilizes **React** (`react`, `react-dom`) with **TypeScript** (`typescript`) as specified in the ADR.

- **Build Tool:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** **Vite** is employed for building the project (`vite`), as evidenced by the build scripts in `package.json`.

- **Linting & Formatting:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** **ESLint** (`eslint`, related plugins) and **Prettier** (`eslint-config-prettier`) are configured for code quality and consistency.

- **Additional Tool:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** **webextension-polyfill** is included to facilitate cross-browser compatibility (`webextension-polyfill`).

### ADR-002: GitHub Integration Approach

- **Authentication:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** Implemented secure authentication using Chrome's Identity API for OAuth through the `GitHubAuthService`.

- **Git Operations:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** Integrated GitHub's REST API for performing commits, pushes, pulls, and merges via the `GitHubApiService`.

- **Repository Management:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** Established default and personal repository options through the `RepositoryManagementService`.

- **Rate Limiting:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** Implemented client-side rate limiting in the background script with configurable thresholds.

- **Error Handling:**
  - **Status:** Implemented
  - **Details:** Added comprehensive error handling with custom error types and proper error propagation.

## Partially Implemented ADRs

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

- **State Management:**
  - **Status:** Not Implemented
  - **Details:** **Redux Toolkit** is not listed in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.

- **Styling:**
  - **Status:** Partially Implemented
  - **Details:** Instead of **CSS Modules** with **Sass**, the project employs **TailwindCSS** (`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`). While TailwindCSS offers a utility-first styling approach, it diverges from the initially proposed styling methodology.

## Summary

**Implemented:**
- **ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection** (Partial implementation with React, TypeScript, Vite, ESLint, Prettier, and webextension-polyfill in place; missing Redux Toolkit and CSS Modules with Sass).
- **ADR-002: GitHub Integration Approach** (Complete implementation with authentication, Git operations, repository management, rate limiting, and error handling).
- **ADR-005: Security and Privacy Measures** (Partial implementation with secure OAuth, encrypted token storage, and client-side operations).

**Partially Implemented:**
- **ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection** (Missing Redux Toolkit; TailwindCSS used instead of CSS Modules with Sass).
- **ADR-003: Local Storage and Data Management** (Implemented encryption service, pending sync module and data schema).

**Pending Implementation:**
- **ADR-004, ADR-006, ADR-007:** Require comprehensive development to align the codebase with the architectural decisions outlined in these ADRs.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Prioritize ADR Implementations:** Focus on implementing ADR-003 (Local Storage and Data Management) next, as it complements the GitHub integration and provides offline functionality.
2. **Conduct Modular Development:** Continue adopting a modular approach to facilitate easier implementation and testing of individual ADRs.
3. **Utilize Tools Efficiently:** Continue using search and code definition tools to verify implementations and identify necessary code modifications.
4. **Update ADRs Post-Implementation:** Once ADRs are implemented, update their status and provide detailed justifications to maintain architectural transparency.

By systematically addressing the pending ADRs, the project can achieve a robust, scalable, and secure architecture that supports its long-term objectives.
