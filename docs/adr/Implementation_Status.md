## Implementation Priorities

1. **High Priority**
   - Complete ADR-016 consolidation process
   - Enhance GitHub Integration (ADR-002)

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Complete Documentation Practices (ADR-012)
   - Implement Plugin Architecture (ADR-007)
   - Review and update ADR-013 and ADR-014

3. **Low Priority**
   - Implement Redux Toolkit (ADR-001)

## Recent Updates

- Created standardized ADR template
- Consolidated review process (ADR-015 superseded by ADR-016)
- Fixed ADR numbering inconsistencies
- Updated implementation status tracking
- Completed Analytics Module implementation (ADR-006)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the consolidation process outlined in ADR-016
2. Review and update ADRs marked as "Not Reviewed"
3. Begin implementation of remaining high-priority items
4. Schedule quarterly ADR reviews

## Notes

- ADR-010 was never created (skipped in numbering)
- All future ADRs should follow the standardized template
- Implementation status should be updated as changes occur
