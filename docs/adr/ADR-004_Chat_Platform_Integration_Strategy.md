# ADR-004: Chat Platform Integration Strategy

### Status

Proposed

### Context

Prompetize aims to integrate with popular chat platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to allow one-click insertion of prompt templates directly into chat interfaces. The integration must be seamless, non-intrusive, and resilient to UI changes in target platforms. Ensuring compatibility, security, and a smooth user experience across different chat environments is critical for the success of this feature.

### Decision

Implement chat platform integration using a comprehensive approach that includes dynamic content script injection, robust error handling, and thorough testing methodologies.

- **Content Script Injection:**
  - **Detection:** 
    - **Implementation:** Monitor the page URL and DOM for supported chat platforms using a whitelist of target domains.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures that the extension only attempts to integrate with known and supported chat platforms, reducing the risk of unintended behavior on unsupported sites.
    
  - **Injection:** 
    - **Implementation:** Dynamically inject a lightweight UI widget (e.g., “Templates” button) into the chat prompt box using MutationObservers to detect changes in the DOM.
    - **Reasoning:** Allows the UI widget to adapt to dynamic changes in the chat platforms' interfaces, maintaining functionality even when the DOM structure changes.
    
- **Dynamic Placeholders:**
  - **Feature:** 
    - **Implementation:** Enable templates to contain placeholders (e.g., `{{userName}}`) that prompt users for input before insertion.
    - **Reasoning:** Provides flexibility in templates, allowing for personalized and context-specific prompt insertion.
    
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - **Implementation:** Support keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+P`) to open the prompt template overlay regardless of the active chat platform.
  - **Reasoning:** Enhances user efficiency by allowing quick access to prompt templates without relying solely on the UI widget.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - **Approach:** 
    - **Implementation:** Utilize try-catch blocks and fallback mechanisms to handle errors gracefully during UI injection and prompt insertion.
    - **Reasoning:** Prevents the extension from breaking the chat platform’s functionality and ensures a smooth user experience even when issues arise.
    
  - **User Notifications:** 
    - **Implementation:** Optionally notify users via non-intrusive alerts or in-extension banners when insertion fails or when updates are required.
    - **Reasoning:** Keeps users informed about the state of the integration and any actions they may need to take, enhancing transparency and trust.
  
### Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - **Streamlined Workflow:** Eliminates manual copy-paste steps, making prompt insertion faster and more efficient.
  - **Enhanced User Experience:** Customizable and smart prompt insertion improves user satisfaction and productivity.
  - **Resilience:** Dynamic configurations and robust error handling ensure the integration remains functional despite UI changes in chat platforms.
  - **Flexibility:** Support for multiple chat platforms broadens the user base and applicability of Prompetize.
  - **Expand on MutationObserver Implementation:** Provide more technical details or references on implementing MutationObservers to assist developers in maintaining the integration.
  - **Include Performance Metrics:** Add performance benchmarks or targets to ensure that DOM monitoring and script injection do not adversely affect browser performance.
  
- **Cons:**
  - **Increased Complexity:** Handling multiple chat platform DOM structures and ensuring compatibility adds development complexity.
  - **Maintenance Overhead:** Continuous updates are required to adapt to changes in target chat platforms, necessitating ongoing maintenance.
  - **Performance Considerations:** Real-time DOM monitoring and dynamic script injection may impact browser performance if not optimized.

### Security Considerations

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  - **Implementation:** Ensure that injected scripts comply with Chrome Extension CSPs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - **Reasoning:** Protects users by restricting the types of content that can be executed, maintaining the integrity of the extension and the chat platforms.
  
- **Data Handling:**
  - **Implementation:** Sanitize any user inputs and template data before insertion to prevent injection attacks.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures that malicious content cannot be injected into chat platforms, safeguarding both users and the extension’s reputation.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
  - **Approach:** Adopt TDD by writing tests for each module and plugin integration points before implementing functionalities.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures that new features and integrations are reliable, maintainable, and do not introduce regressions.
  
- **Automated Testing:**
  - **Unit Tests:**
    - **Implementation:** Use Jest to write unit tests for functions handling DOM detection, script injection, template processing, and error handling.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures that individual components function correctly in isolation.
    
  - **Integration Tests:**
    - **Implementation:** Utilize testing libraries like React Testing Library to verify the interaction between injected UI components and the rest of the extension.
    - **Reasoning:** Validates that different parts of the integration work together seamlessly.
    
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    - **Implementation:** Utilize Cypress to simulate user interactions with the chat platforms, verifying that prompt insertion functions as expected across different environments.
    - **Reasoning:** Confirms that the entire integration flow works smoothly from a user's perspective.
    
  - **Performance Testing:**
    - **Implementation:** Use performance profiling tools to ensure that DOM monitoring and script injection do not degrade browser performance.
    - **Reasoning:** Maintains optimal performance and responsiveness of the extension even as integrations become more complex.
    
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - **Integration:** Incorporate automated tests into the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions. Configure workflows to run tests on every commit and pull request, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionalities.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures code reliability and maintainability by automatically validating changes against the test suite.

### Documentation Updates

- **CHANGELOG:**
  - **Maintenance:** 
    - Document all changes related to chat platform integration, including feature additions, bug fixes, enhancements, and security updates.
    - Provide versioned entries with dates and descriptions to maintain transparency and traceability.
